# Notable_Projects

## R
Contains a selection of scripts from class, work, or personal projects.
My first exposure to R was on a research project with the UVU Economics Club. I picked it back up for my STAT 2050 class. In May of 2019 I started practicing R and attempting to apply wher I had learned at my current job.
The majority of my R experience falls into one of two categories:
- Scripts used at work. A typical workflow would be: connect and query db with `RMySQL` and `DBI`, tidy and anylze with the `tidyverse`(most the time), then write to xlsx or email out using `mailR` or similar methods.
- Scripts used at school. Anything from calculating means and confidence intervals in base R, to attempting optimization methods and predicting learning methods using base R or additional packages.

## SQL
Contains a datacamp project, and some queries I wrote for a job.
The majority of my SQL was self-taught while I worked at ProNexis, I originally learned basic syntax to reasearch issues for helpdesk and later to export data to do analysis in R. Eventually I picked up additional syntax and filled in my gaps to a point of intermediate understanding through online courses. Experience dealing with:
- Basic selection(where, distinct, like, in, etc)
- Joins(inner, outer, left, right, union, union all, self joins)
- Aggregation(sum, count, group by, order by, etc)
- Subqueries(basic subqueries, correlated, Common Table Expresssions, etc)
- Other(CASE statements, some views, etc.)
