# Notable_Projects

## R
Contains a selection of scripts from class, work, or personal projects.
My first exposure to R was on a research project with the UVU Economics Club. I picked it back up for my STAT 2050 class. In May of 2019 I started practicing R and attempting to apply wher I had learned at my current job.
The majority of my R experience falls into one of two categories:
- Scripts used at work. A typical workflow would be: connect and query db with `RMySQL` and `DBI`, tidy and anylze with the `tidyverse`(most the time), then write to xlsx or email out using `mailR` or similar methods.
- Scripts used at school. Anything from calculating means and confidence intervals in base R, to attempting optimization methods and predicting learning methods using base R or additional packages.

## SQL
Contains a datacamp project, and some queries I wrote for a job.
The majority of my SQL was self-taught while I worked at ProNexis, I originally learned basic syntax to reasearch issues for helpdesk and later to export data to do analysis in R. Eventually I picked up additional syntax and filled in my gaps to a point of intermediate understanding through online courses. Experience dealing with:
- Basic `SELECT` syntax(`DISTINCT`, `LIKE`, `ORDER BY`, etc)
- Joins(`INNER`, `OUTER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, full, self)
- Aggregation(`COUNT`, `SUM`, `MAX`, ` GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, etc)
- Subqueries(`IN`, `EXISTS`, inline views, correlated, `WITH` syntax[CTEs], etc, )
- Other(`CASE` statements, some views, etc.)
