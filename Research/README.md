Abstract:
A city is a group of people. Residents select cities in part based on climate. An association between climate and reproduction numbers for SARS-CoV-2 is therefore confounded. For causal inference we harness the randomness of weather. Conditional on climate the variation in weather is random, producing a natural experiment. We conducted a prospective study of growth in official cases of COVID-19 across US cities and observed a correlation between growth rate and the proportion of time when temperature was within an independently specified range. We controlled for confounding by conducting the analysis conditional on a historical measure of temperature. Our study design is instructive as the statistical assumption of ignorable treatment assignment conditional on covariate data is evident from the randomness of the weather. We will present the results of our data analysis and explain how the principles behind our study design are applicable throughout the field of environmental epidemiology
