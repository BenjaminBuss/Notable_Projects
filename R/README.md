# R Projects and Scripts

A selection of personal projects, university assignments, and scripts from previous work experience.

## automated_reports
An example of a daily report that utilitizes `tidyverse` pipelines to wrangle out some metrics on call center agents to be send to call center supervisors and managers.

## dynamic_sampling_procedure
An attempt to try and figure out a dynamic sampling procedure(that adjusts the weights after each individual sample) after a challenge from my STAT 4200(Survey Sampling) professor. A failed project I hope to revisit some day. The start at attempting to mess around with writing my own functions to test different methods.

## stat4000ass4
My first attempt at a using a handwritten kernel method for analysis. Some kinda of bastardization of knn. 
Estimates neighborhood value to be 30.1 with actual value being 30.7.

## kernal_base_boston
The evolution of stat4000ass4, I experiment with different normalization, weighting, and calculating of Euclidian distance.
