# R Projects and Scripts

A selection of personal projects, university assignments, and scripts from previous work experience.

## dynamic_sampling_procedure
An attempt to try and figure out a dynamic sampling procedure(that adjusts the weights after each individual sample) after a challenge from my STAT 4200(Survey Sampling) professor. A failed project I hope to revisit some day.

## stat4000ass4
My first attempt at a using a handwritten kernel method for analysis. Some kinda of bastardization of knn. 
Estimates neighborhood value to be 30.1 with actual value being 30.7.
