# Notes / To Do -----------------------------------------------------------

# How to sample without replacement???
# How to return 'Known' data and implement it into dynamic sampling procedure?
# Weights
# Genetic programming
# 

# Test Cases --------------------------------------------------------------

# Sample size larger than sample
# dynamic_sample(1,5)

# == Exam 2 Test Case ==
