# SQL Scripts & Queries

Select few relevant SQL queries. Most my SQL work experience has been with MySQL 5.7, with some data camp courses which I used PostgreSQL

## Analyze International Debt Statistics(Data Camp Project)
A datacamp.com SQL project demonstrating my ability to read basic instructions and write simple SQL queries.

## complex_join
An extremely messy queries which mashes together `UNION`, `JOINS`, `CASE`, and subqueries is a slow-running hell.

## improved_complex_join
An attempt to simplify the complex_join within the restrictions of MySQL 5.7.

## live_accounts
A simple query to aggregate the number of live accounts based on the distinct number of locations we billed, giving us the total billables and live locations on a monthly and yearly basis. Utilitized `COUNT`, `SUM` and `GROUP BY`.

## long_call_contact_id
A medium-complexity query to determine how many calls matching a certain criteria(length > 120, x != 1, etc) happened. Uses a subquery and `time_to_sec`.
